# PCA_AE_histology
This project was created to compare PCA and Autoencoders as compression tools on histological images of lung tumors. It is presented as a final project for the course “Data Analysis with Machine Learning in Experimental Physics” taught by Professor Paolo Meridiani.

This repository includes a .gitignore file to avoid uploading raw data and other large files. For this reason, the processed data generated by the script 1_augmented_data.ipynb is available at the following drive link, in case you wish to reproduce the results:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kRaWsLcl3BmpR4DKTBF321qoJ5_01fML?usp=sharing.
The raw data used can be found at the following link:

To correctly reproduce the code from scratch, make sure to follow the structure implied by the code itself. Specifically, the dataset must be placed inside a folder named data_histo within the repository.
